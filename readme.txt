1.Download entire dataset from the following links:
PhotoSketch: https://github.com/mtli/PhotoSketch
Sketchy: http://sketchy.eye.gatech.edu/

2. Vanilla GAN (our implementation) model can be accessed from: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_hocm673L-W-zfNAJXqgD7OzasS_ufMG

3. Download Pix2Pix model (Benchmark Model) from hhttps://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

4. For preparing dataset for Pix2Pix model: (a) Divide the data into subfolders: train, test, val and run Combine_data_sketchIT
(Helper function to pre-process data: combine_Images_SketchIT.py)

5. Run our model and Pix2Pix model on dataset with different batchsize and value of lambda. Results are shown here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xM-ntEEx_8KrYJOL9pj87tkVJGJ08rh4?usp=sharing
